Tiptap Custom Bold Extension in React
This project demonstrates how to implement a custom bold extension in Tiptap using React. It showcases how to use Tiptap's headless editor to manage rich text content with the ability to toggle bold formatting. The app consists of the following key parts:

React Integration: Uses useEditor hook from @tiptap/react to create and manage the editor state.
Custom Bold Extension: Adds a toggleBold command to apply bold formatting to selected text, and handles rendering and parsing of the bold text using <strong> tags.
Button for Interaction: A simple button allows users to toggle bold formatting on selected text
